# PDFTron developers site

The new PDFTron developers site created with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

## Install
```
git clone https://github.com/XodoDocs/pdftron-dev-site.git
cd pdftron-dev-site
npm install -g gatsby-cli
npm install
```

## To fetch pages
```
git clone https://github.com/sgong-pdftron/stranger-docs.git src/pages
```

We are basically cloning the stranger docs into `src/pages` so that dev site app could create pages from it.\
In other words, when you make changes to documents, you should navigate to `src/pages` and commit them to `https://github.com/sgong-pdftron/stranger-docs.git`.\
If this is not straight-forward, please talk to Justin or Shirley.

## Run the app in localhost:8000

In `pdftron-dev-site` folder:
```
npm start
```
